# 51dayscodechallenge
# Overview
This repository documents my journey through the 51DaysOfCoding Challenge. I am continuing my 21days to 51dayscoding challenge which i updated from 3rd of January 2024 as part of the #DrGViswanathan initiative by VIT Bhopal University, this initiative allows us to share our small as well as greater milestones uniquely.
# level-up
During this challenge, I committed to solving at least two coding problem each day for next 51days as it is the continuation of 21days challenge.So, from the 22nd day I am updating 1 code daily to 2 code daily. on Platforms like Geeks for Geeks and LeetCode, fostering a consistent coding routine. 
# Structure:
Each day's solution is organized in separate files, each file named after the problem.
The first folder is my 21dayscodechallengepart in which 21days code is present.
The code is written in Java.
Clear and concise comments accompany the code for better understanding.
# Why 51DaysOfCoding?
Participating in the 51DaysOfCoding Challenge allowed me to maintain small yet effective coding streaks, establishing a consistent routine. This practice not only enhanced my problem-solving skills but also prepared me for technical interviews during placement initiatives.
