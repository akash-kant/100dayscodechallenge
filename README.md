# 100dayscodechallenge = 11days to 21days to 50days to 100days continuation...
# Overview
This repository documents my journey through the 100DaysOfCoding Challenge. I am continuing my 21days to 50dayscoding to 100dayscoding challenge as 50daysofcoding which i updated from 3rd of January 2024 as part of the #DrGViswanathan initiative by VIT Bhopal University, is completed on 31st january 2024. Now I am continuing the challenge as 100daysofcoding challenge on 1st February 2024, this initiative allows us to share our small as well as greater milestones uniquely.
# level-up
During this challenge, I committed to solving at least two coding problem each day for next 100days as it is the continuation of 50days challenge.So, from the 51st day I am updating the challenge, on Platforms like Geeks for Geeks and LeetCode, fostering a consistent coding routine. 
# Structure:
Each day's solution is organized in separate files, each file named after the problem.
The first folder is my 21dayscodechallengepart in which 21days code is present.
After 21 days each folder contains daily questions.
The code is written in Java.
Clear and concise comments accompany the code for better understanding.

# Why 100DaysOfCoding?
Participating in the 100DaysOfCoding Challenge allowed me to maintain small yet effective coding streaks, establishing a consistent routine. This practice not only enhanced my problem-solving skills but also prepared me for technical interviews during placement initiatives.
